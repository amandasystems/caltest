# caltest

A very simple wrapper around ical4j. Outputs org-mode formatted headings with event start timestamps.

Uh, don't try this with something that's almost but not entirely an icalendar file.

Also: I've never worked with serious java or clojure projects before, and have really no knowledge of the kind of directory structure that leinigen produces. You have been warned.

## Usage

<binary> <icalendar file>. Or, if you prefer, lein run <icalendar file>.
